# ML-Gym-Clients-Churn-Prediction-and-Clustering
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
I'm here to understand the one of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn.

**We will try to help with those two tools-**
1. Predict customer abandonment using customer data (real time).
2. Classification of customers into groups and thereby finding a group or groups that will constitute "high risk groups for abandonment".

Once the business owners know this data, they will be able to easily increase profits, if of course they improve the findings.
